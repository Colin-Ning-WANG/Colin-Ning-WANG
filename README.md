# :vhs: About Me
With a Bachelor's in Archaeology and a Master's in Anthropology, I chose to enter the gaming industry after graduation and became a game live-ops designer and publishing manager. My main interests lie in analyzing the LTV (Lifetime Value), fine-tuning the FTUE (first-time user experience), and mobile 4X games.
